<h4 style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'; margin-top: -30px;">Research</h4>

My research interests span cryptography, computer security, and privacy with a large focus on blockchain-based systems and distributed protocols. Broadly, I work on interdisciplinary projects that combine knowledge from various fields toward the design of secure and efficient systems and protocols. In my research, I look for real life problems and build solutions backed by rigorous theoretical foundations as well as efficient implementations and thorough performance testing. I also work on conceptual projects that aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice of cryptography.

<div style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'; font-size:17px; background-color:rgb(213, 216, 220);margin-bottom:6px;">Current Projects</div>

* **chainBoost:** Develop secure frameworks for boosting performance and improving scalability of Web 3.0 and DeFi, as well as foundations of provable security for blockchain-based resource markets and sidechains. <br/> 
_Funded by NSF_

* **Basing cryptography on biological assumptions:** Construct bounded-query memory devices, or consumable tokens, from proteins, and use them in various cryptographic applications such as digital lockers and bounded-execution programs. More about it in our ([paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-06944-4_26), [Eurocrypt 2022](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2022/)).

* **smartFHE:** Build a privacy-preserving smart contract (PPSC) scheme using fully homomorphic encryption and non-interactive zero knowledge proofs. More about the smartFHE framework can be found in our paper [smartFHE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/133), and more about current private computing solutions for blockchains can be found in our ([SoK paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/727.pdf), [EuroS&P 2022](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2022/)).

* **PrivML:** Use privacy technologies---MPC, FHE, threshold cryptography, and zero knowledge proofs---to tackle privacy issues in machine learning (covering both federated learning and inference). Explore directions to support dynamic participation in these protocols and settings with restricted interaction patterns between users. <br/>

* **Gage MPC:** Develop a new MPC model to circumvent the leakage of the residual function, and enforce complete fairness, in non-interactive MPC (NIMPC). We introduce new primitives---monetary incentivised time lock capsules and a robust version of garbled circuits---and combine them with smart contracts to economically incentivize participants/miners to evaluate the intended MPC functionality. More about Gage MPC can be found in our paper ([Gage MPC, PETS 2021](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/256)).


* **CacheCash:** A system that provides a decentralized content delivery network (CDN) service by forming a distributed bandwidth marketplace powered by a cryptocurrency. This project covered several components including a threat modeling framework for cryptocurrencies ([ABC, CryBlock 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8845101)), a defense mechanism against cache accounting attacks ([CAPnet, IEEE CNS 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802825)), a lightweight probabilistic micropayment scheme ([MicroCash, FC 2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-51280-4_13)), and CacheCash ([CacheCash, PhD Thesis 2019](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-kmv2-7n57)), the main system that integrates these modules together along with innovative cryptographic and financial security defenses.


* **Privacy-preserving programming compiler extension:** Build the first framework to support pointers to private data for privacy preserving programming compilers. This involved extending the PICCO compiler to implement this framework, and studying the efficiency trade-offs of using pointers to private data in secure algorithms and protocols. Read about this framework in our [TOPS 2017](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3154600) paper.


* **Privacy-preserving genome testing:** Develop protocols that perform genome tests to detect gene mutations without revealing any information about the underlying genome sequences. This project was a submission to the 4th [iDash Privacy & Security Workshop](http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2015/) competition. Read about these protocols in our [BMC 2015](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6947-15-S5-S4) paper.
