*Still under construction! More to be added soon.*


<h1 style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">Research</h1>

My research interests span cryptography, computer systems security, and privacy. Broadly, I work on interdisciplinary projects that combine knowledge from various fields toward the design of secure systems and protocols. In my research, I look for real life problems and build solutions backed by rigorous theoretical foundations as well as efficient implementations and thorough performance testing. I am also interested in conceptual projects that contribute in bridging the gap between theory and practice of Cryptography.

* **CacheCash:** A system that provides a decentralized content delivery network (CDN) service by forming a distributed bandwidth marketplace powered by a cryptocurrency. This project covered several components including a threat modeling framework for cryptocurrencies ([ABC, CryBlock 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8845101)), a defense mechanism against cache accounting attacks in peer-assisted CDNs ([CAPnet, IEEE CNS 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802825)), a lightweight probabilistic micropayment scheme ([MicroCash, FC 2020](https://fc20.ifca.ai/preproceedings/38.pdf)), and CacheCash, the main system that integrates these modules into its design.


* **Privacy-preserving programming compiler extension:** Build the first framework to support pointers to private data for privacy preserving programming compilers. This involved extending the PICCO compiler to implement this framework, and studying the efficiency trade-offs of using pointers to private data in secure algorithms and protocols. Read about this framework in our [TOPS 2017](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3154600) paper.


* **Privacy-preserving genome testing:** Develop protocols that perform genome tests to detect gene mutations without revealing any information about the underlying genome sequences. This project was a submission to the 4th [IDash Privacy & Security Workshop](http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2015/) competition. Read about these protocols in our [BMC 2015](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6947-15-S5-S4) paper.
