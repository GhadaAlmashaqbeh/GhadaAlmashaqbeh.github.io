*Still under construction! More to be added soon.*


<h1 style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">Research</h1>

My research interests span cryptography, security, privacy, and distributed systems. Broadly, I work on interdisciplinary projects that combine knowledge from various fields toward the design of secure systems and protocols. In my research, I look for real life problems and build solutions backed by rigorous theoretical foundations as well as efficient implementations and thorough performance testing. I am also interested in conceptual projects that contribute in bridging the gap between theory and practice of Cryptography. 


<h4 style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'">Current Projects</h4>
    
* **Privacy preserving computing:** Develop primitives and protocols that allow multiple parties to perform computations on their private data without revealing anything about the input beyond what is inferred from the output. This project targets medical and financial data and aims to build secure protocols that handle realistic settings efficiently. Read about the protocols developed so far in our [BMC 2015](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6947-15-S5-S4) and [TOPS 2017](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3154600) papers.
      

* **Basing cryptography on biological polymers:** In stealthy mode :)

* **CacheCash:** A system that provides a decentralized content delivery network (CDN) service by forming a distributed bandwidth marketplace powered by a cryptocurrency. This project covered several components including a threat modeling framework for cryptocurrencies ([ABC, CryBlock 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8845101)), a defense mechanism against cache accounting attacks in peer-assisted CDNs ([CAPnet, IEEE CNS 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8802825)), a lightweight probabilistic micropayment scheme ([MicroCash, FC 2020](https://fc20.ifca.ai/preproceedings/38.pdf)), and CacheCash, the main system that integrates these modules into its design.
