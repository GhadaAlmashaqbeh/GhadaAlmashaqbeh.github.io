<p>I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://cachecash.com">CacheCash</a>, a new startup that builds a fully distributed content delivery network (CDN) service powered by a cryptocurrency. My research interests cover theory and applied cryptography, security, privacy, and distributed systems. More information about my research work can be found <a href="/research/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I received my PhD in Computer Science from Columbia University in Spring 2019. I was a member of the <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/crypto">Cryptography Lab</a> and the <a href="https://datascience.columbia.edu/">Data Science Institute</a> at Columbia. During the PhD I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.thecomputersciencecomedian.com">Allison Bishop</a> (<a href="https://prooftrading.com/">Proof Trading</a> and Cryptography lab at Columbia) and <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal">Tal Malkin</a> (Cryptography lab at Columbia). I also worked closely with <a href="https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/personalpages/jcappos/">Justin Cappos</a> (<a href="https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu">Secure Systems Lab</a> at NYU).</p>
