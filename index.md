I am an assistant professor in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.uconn.edu/) department at UConn. My [research interests](/research/) cover cryptography, computer systems security, and privacy. I am an affiliated member at the [Connecticut Advanced Computing Center (CACC)](https://cacc.uconn.edu/) and the [Engineering for Human Rights Initiative](https://engineeringforhumanrights.uconn.edu/) at UConn. Before joining UConn, I spent a while exploring the entrepreneurship world. I cofounded CacheCash, a decentralized cryptocurrency-based content delivery network (CDN), which was the core work I've done for my PhD thesis! I also worked as a Cryptographer at [NuCypher](https://www.nucypher.com/). Now, I am a scientific advisor for Sunscreen Tech.
 
I received my PhD in Computer Science from Columbia University in 2019, where I was a member of the [Cryptography Lab](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/crypto) and the [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/). During the PhD I was fortunate to have [Allison Bishop](https://www.thecomputersciencecomedian.com) and [Tal Malkin](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal) as my advisors.
